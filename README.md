Installing Elm

The '-g' indicates that elm will be installed in the machine global node (no the local one)
However a folder "elm-stuff" will be located in the root folder with the elm dependencies

```
npm install -g elm-test
npm install -g elm-test
npm install -g elm-css
```

To verify it is correctly installed:
```
elm‐make ‐‐version 
elm‐make 0.18.0 (Elm Platform 0.18.0)
```
